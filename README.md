Welcome to the Palm 2ðŸŒ´ Chatbot project! This Streamlit app provides an interactive interface for users to communicate with the Palm 2ðŸŒ´ Chatbot. The chatbot is capable of interpreting code, prompting the user, exporting code to repl.it, and displaying images.

## Features

- **Language Selection**: Users can select their preferred language from a list. The language codes are loaded from a `lang.json` file.
  
- **Code Interpreter**: The chatbot can interpret and execute code snippets. Users can toggle this feature on or off.
  
- **System Prompt**: Users can set a system prompt for the code interpreter. The default prompt is: "Rule 1: If a user requests a code snippet, provide only one that can run in a Streamlit app without requiring additional libraries."
  
- **Export to repl.it**: Users have the option to export the interpreted code to repl.it.
  
- **Image Display**: The chatbot can display images in the chat interface. Users can toggle the display of images on or off.
